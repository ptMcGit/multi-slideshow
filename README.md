# MultiSlideShow #

## What is it? ##

`MultiSlideShow` is used to create slideshows.

A slideshow in this case is the following:

- a group of slides, each with with different attributes
- a way of changing the current slide
- a way of displaying the current slide

## How to use it ##

Add it to your environment...

Create an array of slides:

``` JavaScript
var mySlides = [
  {title: 'cool',     imgUrl: './img/cool.png',     altText: 'a beach in Tofino'},
  {title: 'tubular',  imgUrl: './img/tubular.png'}, altText: 'in the hills in Pasadena'},
];
```

Instantiate `MultiSlideShow`:

``` JavaScript
var mySlideShow = MultiSlideShow(mySlides);
```

'Bind' object members to html elements using `bindElement()`:

``` JavaScript
// This causes the innerHTML of the element to be associated with the title attribute of mySlides.

mySlideShow.bindElement(
  [document.getElementById('photo-slideshow-title')], /* choose an element */
  'innerHTML',  /* choose the member of the element that you want to change */
  'title'       /* choose the member of any given 'slide' which will supply the value */
);

// NOTE that the first argument is an array, allowing for multiple elements to be associated with a slide attribute

// The same can be done with the image src:

mySlideShow.bindElement(
  [document.getElementById('photo-slideshow-imgUrl')],
  'src',
  'imgUrl'
);

// And, so on...
```

A slideshow needs a way to be moved forwards and backwards.

This can be done by setting the slide with `.setSlide()`.
`.setSlide()` return the current slide index when invoked with no arguments.

`MultiSlideShow` also has the ability to create event listeners for events that trigger the slideshow forwards and backwards.
These events are bound to elements by using `.bindNextEvent()` and `.bindPrevEvent()` methods:

``` JavaScript
mySlideShow.bindNextEvent(
  document.getElementById('photo-slideshow-next-button'), /* element that generates an event */
  'click'   /* event generated by the element above */
);

mySlideShow.bindPrevEvent(
  document.getElementById('photo-slideshow-prev-button'),
  'click'
);
```

Additionally, an individual slide can be associatedted with an event directly through the use of `.bindEvent()`.
In this case the button causes the slidehow to go to the first slide each time:

```JavaScript
mySlideShow.bindEvent(
  0,
  document.getElementById('photo-slideshow-reset-button'),
  'click'
);
```
